# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
<h1 align="center"> Credit Fraud Detector </h1>


<h2> Introduction </h2>
we will use various predictive models to see how accurate they  are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud. As described in the dataset, the features are scaled and the names of the features are not shown due to privacy reasons. Nevertheless, we can still analyze some important aspects of the dataset. Let's start!


<h2> Our Goals: </h2>
<ul>
<li> Understand the little distribution of the "little" data that was provided to us. </li>
<li> Create a 50/50 sub-dataframe ratio of "Fraud" and "Non-Fraud" transactions</li>
<li> Use Logistic Regression Classifiers we are going to use and Check accuracy. </li>
</ul>


<h2> Outline: </h2>
I. <b>Understanding our data</b><br>
a) Gather Sense of our data<br><br>

II. <b>Preprocessing</b><br>
a) Scaling and Distributing<br>
b) Splitting the Data<br><br>

III. <b>Oversampling</b><br>
a) Distributing and Correlating<br>
b) Oversampling with SMOTE<br><br>

IV. <b>Testing </b><br>
a) Testing with Logistic Regression<br>
